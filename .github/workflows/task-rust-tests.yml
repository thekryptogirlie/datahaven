# Rust Tests: CI for Rust components (DataHaven runtime and node Rust tests)
#
# Overview:
# 1. Prepare: This job handles the setup phase where the cargo nextest archive is created
#    and uploaded to the workflow for use in the subsequent jobs
# 2. All Rust Tests: Executes the full suite of Rust tests across two partitions to
#    to reduce total execution time.
